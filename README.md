<h1>Encryption</h1>
<h2>Introducton</h2>
<p>Encryption is the process of converting data into an encoded format
so that unauthorized people can't access it. Only people with the
decryption key can read it. Encryption is usually used to protect data
such as passwords, medical records, financial information, and
people's personal messages so that hackers and cyber criminals can't
get to it.</p>
<h3>Types of encryption (Symmetric vs asymmetric)</h3>
<p>There are two main types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric.
Symmetric encryption uses the same key to lock and unlock the data.
Asymmetric encryption uses two keys, one to lock and another to unlock
the data. This is slower but is used in things like email encryption,
digital signatures, and secure website connections. Encryption helps
ensure that even if someone gets their hands on your data, they can't
read it without the key. Encryption is very important for keeping
information safe and preventing unauthorized use.</p>
<h3>How encryption protects Data</h3>
<p>When data is “in transit,” like when someone sends a message or
logs into an online bank account, encryption protects it while it’s
moving across the internet so hackers can’t read it even if they
intercept it. When data is “at rest,” like files stored in the cloud
or on a hard drive, encryption makes sure that even if someone gains
access to the storage itself, they still cannot read the information
without the key. This is why companies, hospitals, and financial
institutions use encryption for legal compliance and security.</p>
<h3>Why strong encryption matters</h3>
<p>Not all encryption is equally safe. Older or weak encryption
methods can be cracked by hackers using modern tools, making personal
information easy to steal. If data is unencrypted or uses outdated
protection, things like passwords, bank accounts, medical records, and
private messages can be exposed. Strong, updated encryption reduces
the chances of data leaks, identity theft, and cyber attacks, and is a
requirement for many privacy laws.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, encryption is one of the most important defenses against
hacking and data theft. It does not stop attackers from trying to
steal information, but it makes stolen information useless without the
right key. As technology grows and more personal data moves online,
using strong and updated encryption is essential for protecting
privacy, preventing identity theft, and following legal data
protection rules.</p>
